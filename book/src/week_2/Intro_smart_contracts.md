# **Introduction to Smart Contracts**

## Long before blockchain technology, American cryptographer and programmer, Nick Szabo, proposed the idea of the smart contracts in 1996. At the time of his proposal, the distributed ledger did not exist, and thus his idea could be not built upon. The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2008, which helped to motivate the development of smart contracts. In 2013, Ethereum became the first platform to host smart contracts. Now, there are plenty of platforms that are used to bring Szabo's idea to life. 

## Solidity is high-level, object-oriented programming language used to implement smart contracts. It is the primary programming language used on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Anchor is Solana's Sealevel runtime framework. It provides several developer tools for writing smart contracts in order to simplify the process and help developers to focus on their product.
