# Testing

## The test runner automates the execution and management of tests for a Move program. The test runner executes the test cases and verifies whether the actual results match the expected results. It collects the test outcomes, such as passing or failing, and generates a report summarizing the results. This report helps developers identify any issues or regressions in the Move programs and assists in debugging and troubleshooting.
### In the Move language, there are several relevant directives that can be used to facilitate testing. These directives provide instructions to the Move compiler and test runner regarding how to handle specific aspects of testing. The 'pragma test' directive marks a function or procedure as a test case. It signals the test runner to identify and execute this specific function as part of the test suite. The 'pragma pub' directive defines a test block, grouping related test cases together. The 'pragma enable_experimental' directive enables experimental features or behaviors in the Move compiler or test runner. It is commonly used when testing new or upcoming language features that are still in the experimental stage. The 'pragma enable_test' directive enables specific testing-related functionality, such as capturing and reporting test results or mocking external dependencies, during the compilation or execution of Move programs. 

### Assertions serve as checkpoints within test cases to verify if specific conditions hold true during testing. They are typically written as boolean statements and used to validate the correctness of Move programs, ensuring that the expected behavior and properties are upheld.

## The organization of testing refers to the structuring and arrangement of tests within a project or codebase. It involves determining how to categorize and group tests, as well as defining the overall testing strategy and hierarchy.
### The recommended organization pattern for testing varies depending on the project. However, for Move smart contracts, the contract-level testing pattern is used. In this pattern, 

## Mocks and stubs are both techniques used to simulate or replace certain components of a system being tested. A mock is a fake implementation of a method or an object, meant to simulate its real behavior. Stubs, on the other hand, are simplified implementations that do not imitate the real behavior. Instead, stubs produce a predefined response to a specific method call or input. Thus, mocks verify the behavior of code and stubs verify the state of the code.
### State-based simulation is a testing technique that focuses on verifying a program based the correctness of its state transitions. First, one must identify and define the states that the program can be in. Next, the events or actions that trigger a transition between states must be defined. Using this information, proper test cases should be generated to explore different state transitions and scenarios.
