# Building with Movement
Welcome to *Building with Movemnt*! Over the course of this book, we will be addressing topics related to developing for the movemnt blockchain.

This book was originally developed for a month-long hackathon, and so has content covering four weeks. While we think this pacing is nice, the book is concise enough to do in far less time and resumable enough to spread it out even further.

By the end of this book, you will have the skills to build for the movemnt blockchain and the contextual awareness to understand its advantages.
