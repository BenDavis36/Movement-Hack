# Building with Movement
Welcome to *Building with Movement*! Over the course of this booklet, we will be addressing topics related to developing for the Movement blockchain.

This booklet was originally developed for a month-long hackathon, and so has content covering four weeks. While we think this pacing is nice, the book is concise enough to do in far less time and resumable enough to spread out over more time.

By the end of this book, you will have the skills to build for the Movement blockchain and the contextual awareness to understand its advantages.
