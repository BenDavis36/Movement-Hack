# Guidelines
This section outlines some best practices for the project and Movement success, as well as how to get in touch with the team for support.

## Requirements Gathering

Requirements gathering is a critical phase in the software development process that involves capturing, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders. It lays the foundation for a successful project by ensuring a clear understanding of what needs to be built. Here are some steps for successful requirements gathering:

1. **Identify Stakeholders:** Identify and involve all relevant stakeholders, including clients, end-users, subject matter experts, and other project team members. Each stakeholder brings unique perspectives and insights into the project requirements.

2. **Define the Scope:** Clearly define the scope of the project by outlining its objectives, boundaries, and limitations. This helps set realistic expectations and ensures that the requirements gathering process remains focused.

3. **Conduct Interviews and Workshops:** Engage in one-on-one interviews and group workshops with stakeholders to gather their input, understand their needs, and identify any existing challenges or pain points. Encourage open and honest communication to capture comprehensive requirements.

4. **Document Requirements:** Document the gathered requirements in a structured manner, ensuring clarity, completeness, and traceability. Use techniques such as use cases, user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, and process flows to capture different aspects of the system.

5. **Validate and Verify:** Validate the gathered requirements by reviewing them with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and alignment with their expectations. Seek their feedback and address any concerns or discrepancies. Verify the requirements against the project objectives and constraints.

6. **Prioritize Requirements:** Prioritize the requirements based on their importance, urgency, and impact on project success. Collaborate with stakeholders to establish a clear understanding of the most critical and high-priority features.

7. **Iterate and Refine:** Requirements gathering is an iterative process. Continuously refine and iterate the requirements based on feedback, changing project needs, and evolving stakeholder requirements. Regularly communicate and collaborate with stakeholders to ensure ongoing alignment.

Remember, successful requirements gathering involves effective communication, active listening, and collaboration with stakeholders throughout the process. By following these steps, developers can gather comprehensive and accurate requirements that form a solid foundation for successful software development.

## Pitching and presenting

### Crafting a paper and deck
Crafting a concise and visually appealing pitch deck is crucial for effectively presenting your small blockchain project at the end of a hackathon. Structure your deck to highlight the problem your project solves, the solution you've developed, the target market, and the unique value it offers. Emphasize the key features and benefits of your project, along with any notable achievements during the hackathon. Use clear and concise language, visual aids, and a consistent design to enhance the overall presentation.

> We've provided a templates for LaTeX and PPT in `presentations/templates`.

### The pitch
During the pitch, focus on delivering a compelling and concise message that captures the attention of the judges and participants. Clearly articulate the problem your project addresses, the solution it provides, and how it leverages blockchain technology. Highlight the practical applications, benefits, and potential market opportunities of your project. Demonstrate how your project differentiates itself from existing solutions and how it aligns with the hackathon's theme or challenges. Be confident, enthusiastic, and passionate about your project, conveying the potential impact and value it brings.

### The presentation
When delivering your presentation, aim for clarity, professionalism, and effective communication. Begin with a concise and attention-grabbing introduction to hook the audience. Provide a brief overview of your project's development process, focusing on the key milestones achieved during the hackathon. Showcase any live demos, prototypes, or working features of your project, demonstrating its functionality and value proposition. Highlight the technical aspects of your project, such as the blockchain technology used, any smart contracts implemented, and the scalability or security measures in place. Conclude your presentation with a compelling call-to-action, inviting the judges and participants to engage with your project and explore its potential.
